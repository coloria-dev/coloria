### Abstract

Available colour-discrimination data for surface colours have been analysed to produce
chromaticity-discrimination ellipses for individual colour centres.  Applying simulated
errors showed that when the distribution of samples around a standard was
unsatisfactory, the ellipses obtained were unreliable. A total of 132 reliable ellipses
were obtained. The values of 6 and a/b varied systematically over the chro-maticity
diagram, the patterns from acceptability, perceptibility, textile, and non-textile
ellipses being very similar. New experimental data involving over 400 pairs of samples
corresponding to 70 of the colour centres and assessed against a grey scale were used to
adjust the relative sizes of the ellipses. Overall set factors were used to bring data
from different sources onto a common scale. However, even after allowing for different
lightness levels, the sizes of the ellipses still appeared to be irregular. Using the
new results to adjust the sizes of the individual ellipses from any one group of data,
e.g., BFD, DF, or MMB, gave ellipses forming a much more regular pattern. In contrast to
the MacAdam ellipses, the smallest ellipses occurred in the blue-grey region. Our
results imply that the relative sizes of the ellipses from the same group of data are in
error by a factor of two or more. Comparing colour differences for different colours
appears to be much more difficult than has been previously realised. The problem appears
to have affected all the major groups of published data.
