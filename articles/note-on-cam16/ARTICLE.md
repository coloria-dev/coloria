# Algorithmic improvements for the CIECAM02 and CAM16 color appearance models

##### Abstract

_This note is concerned with the CIECAM02 color appearance model and its
successor, the CAM16 color appearance model. Several algorithmic flaws are
pointed out and remedies are suggested. The resulting color model is
algebraically equivalent to CIECAM02/CAM16, but shorter, more efficient, and
works correctly for all edge cases._

## Introduction

The CIECAM02 color appearance model \cite{ciecam02} has attracted much attention and was
generally thought of as a successor to the ever so popular CIELAB color model. However,
it was quickly discovered that CIECAM02 breaks down for certain input values. A fair
number of research articles suggests fixes for this behavior, most of them by modifying
the first steps of the forward model. Luo and Li give an overview of the suggested
improvements \cite{ciecam02-recent}; see references therein. Most recently, Li and
Luo \cite{cam16} gave their own suggestion on how to best circumvent the
breakdown \cite{cam16}. The updated algorithm differs from the original CIECAM02 only in
the first steps of the forward model.

It appears that that the rest of the algorithm has not received much attention over the
years. In both CIECAM02 and its updated version CAM16, some of the steps are more
complicated than necessary, and in edge cases lead to break downs once again. The
present document [describes those flaws and suggests improvements](#flaws-and-fixes).
[The resulting model description](#full-model) is entirely equivalent to the
CIECAM02/CAM16, but is simpler – hence faster and easier to implement – and works in all
edge cases.

All findings in this article are implemented in the open-source software package
[Coloria](https://github.com/nschloe/coloria).

## Flaws and fixes

This section describes the flaws of CAM16 and suggests fixes for them. Some of them are
trivial, others are harder to see. All listed steps also appear in the CIECAM02 color
appearance model and trivially apply there.

### Step 3, forward model

The original Step 3 of the forward model reads

> Calculate the postadaptation cone response
> (resulting in dynamic range compression).
>
> ```math
> R_a = 400 \frac{\left(\frac{F_L R_c}{100}\right)^{0.42}}{\left(\frac{F_L R_c}{100}\right)^{0.42} + 27.13} + 0.1
> ```
>
> If $`R_c`$ is negative, then
>
> ```math
> R_a = -400 \frac{\left(\frac{-F_L R_c}{100}\right)^{0.42}}{\left(\frac{-F_L R_c}{100}\right)^{0.42} + 27.13} + 0.1
> ```
>
> and similarly for the computations of $`G_a`$ and $`B_a`$.

If the $`\operatorname{sign}`$ operator is used here as it is used later in step 5 of
the inverse model, the above description can be shortened.

Furthermore, the term $`0.1`$ is added here, but in all of the following steps in which
$`R_a`$ is used – except the computation of $`t`$ in Step 9 –, it cancels out
algebraically. Unfortunately, said cancellation is not always exact when computed in
floating point arithmetic. Luckily, the adverse effect of such rounding errors is rather
limited here. The results will only be distorted for very small input values, e.g.,
$`X=Y=Z=0`$; see Table \ref{tab:zero}. For the sake of consistency, it is advisable to
include the term $`0.1`$ only in the computation of $`t`$ in Step 9:

```math
  R'_a = 400 \operatorname{sign}(R_c) \frac{{\left(\frac{F_L |R_c|}{100}\right)}^{0.42}}{{\left(\frac{F_L |R_c|}{100}\right)}^{0.42} + 27.13}.
```

### Linear combinations, forward model

In the forward model, four linear combinations of $`R'_a`$, $`G'_a`$, and $`B'_a`$ have
to be formed. They can conveniently be expressed as the matrix-vector multiplication

```math
\begin{pmatrix}
  p'_2\\[0.5ex]
  a\\[0.5ex]
  b\\[0.5ex]
  u
\end{pmatrix}
\coloneqq
\begin{pmatrix}
  2 & 1 & \tfrac{1}{20}\\[0.5ex]
  1 & -\tfrac{12}{11} & \tfrac{1}{11}\\[0.5ex]
  \tfrac{1}{9} & \tfrac{1}{9} & -\tfrac{2}{9}\\[0.5ex]
  1 & 1 & \tfrac{21}{20}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  R'_a\\G'_a\\B'_a
\end{pmatrix}
```

which on many platforms can be computed significantly faster than four
individual dot-products.
The last variable $`u`$ is used in the computation of $`t`$ in step 9.

### Step 9, forward model

> Calculate the correlates of [...] saturation ($`s`$).
>
> ```math
> s \coloneqq 100 \sqrt{M/Q}.
> ```

This expression is not well-defined if $`Q=0`$, a value occurring if the input values
are $`X=Y=Z=0`$. When making use of the definition of $`M`$ and $`Q`$, one gets to an
expression for $`s`$ that is well-defined in all cases:

```math
\begin{align*}
\alpha&\coloneqq t^{0.9} {(1.64-0.29^n)}^{0.73},\\
s &\coloneqq 50 \sqrt{\frac{c\alpha}{A_w + 4}}.
\end{align*}
```

### Steps 2 and 3, inverse model

- Step 2:
  Calculate $`t`$, $`e_t`$, $`p_1`$, $`p_2`$, and $`p_3`$.

  ```math
  \begin{align*}
  t   &= {\left(\frac{C}{\sqrt{\frac{J}{100}} {(1.64 - 0.29^n)}^{0.73}}\right)}^\frac{1}{0.9},\\
  e_t &= \frac{1}{4} \left[\cos(h'\pi/180\degree + 2) + 3.8\right],\\
  p_1 &= \frac{50000}{13} N_c N_{cb} e_t \frac{1}{t},\\
  p_2 &= \frac{A}{N_{bb}} + 0.305,\\
  p_3 &= \frac{21}{20}.
  \end{align*}
  ```

- Step 3:
  Calculate $`a`$ and $`b`$. If $`t=0`$, then $`a=b=0`$ and go to Step 4. In the next
  computations be sure transform $`h`$ from degrees to radians before calculating
  $`\sin(h)`$ and $`\cos(h)`$: If $`|\sin(h)| \ge |\cos(h)|`$ then
  ```math
  \begin{align*}
  p_4 &= \frac{p_1}{\sin(h)},\\
  b &= \frac{p_2 (2+p_3) \frac{460}{1403}}{p_4 + (2+p_3) \frac{220}{1403} \frac{\cos(h)}{\sin(h)} - \frac{27}{1403} + p_3 \frac{6300}{1403}},\\
  a &= b \frac{\cos(h)}{\sin(h)}.
  \end{align*}
  ```
  If $`|\cos(h)| > |\sin(h)|`$ then
  ```math
  \begin{align*}
  p_5 &= \frac{p_1}{\cos(h)},\\
  a &= \frac{p_2 (2+p_3) \frac{460}{1403}}{%
  p_5 + (2+p_3) \frac{220}{1403} -
  \left(\frac{27}{1403} - p_3 \frac{6300}{1403}\right) \frac{\sin(h)}{\cos(h)}
  },\\
  b &= a \frac{\sin(h)}{\cos(h)}.
  \end{align*}
  ```

Some of the complications in this step stem from the fact that the variable $`t`$ might
be $`0`$ in the denominator of $`p_1`$. Likewise, the distinction of cases in $`\sin(h)`$
and $`\cos(h)`$ is necessary to avoid division by $`0`$ in $`a`$ and $`b`$.

It turns out that both of these problems can be avoided quite elegantly.
Consider, in the case $`|\sin(h)| \ge |\cos(h)|`$:

```math
\begin{align*}
p'_1 &\coloneqq \frac{50000}{13} N_c N_{cb} e_t,\\
b &= \frac{p_2 (2+p_3) \frac{460}{1403}}{\frac{p'_1}{t\sin(h)} + (2+p_3) \frac{220}{1403} \frac{\cos(h)}{\sin(h)} - \frac{27}{1403} + p_3 \frac{6300}{1403}}\\
  &= \frac{t \sin(h) p_2 (2+p_3) \frac{460}{1403}}{p'_1 + t (2+p_3) \frac{220}{1403} \cos(h) + t \sin(h) \frac{6588}{1403}}\\
  &= \frac{23 t \sin(h) p_2}{23 p'_1 + 11 t \cos(h) + 108 t \sin(h)},
\end{align*}
```

and

```math
a = \frac{23 t \cos(h) p_2}{23 p'_1 + 11 t \cos(h) + 108 t \sin(h)}.
```

Conveniently, the exact same expressions are retrieved in the case
$`|\cos(h)| > |\sin(h)|`$. These expressions are always well-defined since

```math
23 p'_1 + 11 t \cos(h) + 108 t \sin(h)
= \frac{23 p'_1 p_2}{R'_a + G'_a + \tfrac{21}{20}B'_a + 0.305}
> 0.
```

In the algorithm, the value of $`t`$ can be retrieved via
$`\alpha`$ \eqref{eq:alpha} from the input variables. Indeed, if the saturation
correlate $`s`$ is given, one has

```math
\alpha \coloneqq {\left(\frac{s}{50}\right)}^2 \frac{A_w+4}{c};
```

if $`M`$ is given, one can compute $`C\coloneqq M / F_L^{0.25}`$ and then

```math
\alpha\coloneqq\begin{cases}
  0                      & \text{if } J=0,\\
  \frac{C}{\sqrt{J/100}} & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
```

It is mildly unfortunate that one has to introduce a case distinction for
$`J=0`$ here, but this is an operation that can still be performed at reasonable
efficiency.

### Full model

For the convenience of the reader, both forward and inverse steps of the improved CAM16
algorithm are given here. The wording is taken from \cite{cam16} where applicable. The
steps that differ from the original model are marked with an asterisk (\*).

As an abbreviation, the notation $`[R,G,B]`$ is used whenever the equation applies
to $`R`$, $`G`$, and $`B`$ alike.

##### Illuminants, viewing surrounds set up and background parameters

(See the note at the end of Part 2 of Appendix B of \cite{cam16} for determining
all parameters.)

- Adopted white in test illuminant: $`X_w`$, $`Y_w`$, $`Z_w`$
- Background in test conditions: $`Y_b`$
- Reference white in reference illuminant: $`X_{wr}=Y_{wr} = Z_{wr}=100`$, fixed in the model
- Luminance of test adapting field (cd / m²): $`L_A`$.
  $`L_A`$ is computed using
  ```math
  L_A = \frac{E_W}{\pi} \frac{Y_b}{Y_W} = \frac{L_W Y_b}{Y_W},
  ```
  where $`E_W =\pi L_W`$ is the illuminance of reference white in lux;
  $`L_W`$ is the luminance of reference white in cd/m²;
  $`Y_b`$ is the luminance factor of the background;
  and $`Y_w`$ is the luminance factor of the reference white.
- Surround parameters are given in Table \ref{tab:surround}:
  To determine the surround conditions see the note at the
  end of Part 1 of Appendix A of \cite{cam16}.
- $`N_c`$ and $`F`$ are modelled as a function of $`c`$, and their values
  can be linearly interpolated, using the data from \ref{tab:surround}.

Let $`M_{16}`$ be given by

```math
M_{16} \coloneqq \begin{pmatrix}
0.401288 & 0.650173 & -0.051461\\
-0.250268 & 1.204414 & 0.045854\\
-0.002079 & 0.048952 & 0.953127
\end{pmatrix}.
```

- Step 1:
  Calculate "cone" responses.

  ```math
  \begin{pmatrix}R\\G\\B\end{pmatrix}
  = M_{16} \begin{pmatrix}X\\Y\\Z\end{pmatrix}
  ```

- Step 2:
  Complete the color adaptation of the illuminant in
  the corresponding cone response space (considering various
  luminance levels and surround conditions included in $`D`$, and
  hence in $`D_R`$, $`D_G`$, and $`D_B`$).

  ```math
  [R,G,B]_c = D_{[R,G,B]} \cdot [R,G,B]
  ```

- Step 3\*:
  Calculate the modified postadaptation cone response
  (resulting in dynamic range compression).

  ```math
  [R,G,B]'_a = 400 \operatorname{sign}([R,G,B]_c)
    \frac
    {{\left(\frac{F_L |[R,G,B]_c|}{100}\right)}^{0.42}}
    {{\left(\frac{F_L |[R,G,B]_c|}{100}\right)}^{0.42} + 27.13}.
  ```

- Step 4\*:
  Calculate Redness–Greenness ($`a`$), Yellowness–Blueness ($`b`$) components,
  hue angle ($`h`$), and auxiliary variables ($`p'_2`$, $`u`$).

  ```math
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      p'_2\\[0.5ex]
      a\\[0.5ex]
      b\\[0.5ex]
      u
    \end{pmatrix}
    &\coloneqq
    \begin{pmatrix}
      2 & 1 & \tfrac{1}{20}\\[0.5ex]
      1 & -\tfrac{12}{11} & \tfrac{1}{11}\\[0.5ex]
      \tfrac{1}{9} & \tfrac{1}{9} & -\tfrac{2}{9}\\[0.5ex]
      1 & 1 & \tfrac{21}{20}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      R'_a\\G'_a\\B'_a
    \end{pmatrix},\\
    % a&\coloneqq R'_a - \tfrac{12}{11} G'_a + \tfrac{1}{11} B'_a\\
    % b&\coloneqq \tfrac{1}{9} R'_a + \tfrac{1}{9} G'_a - \tfrac{2}{9} B'_a\\
    h&\coloneqq \arctan(b/a).
  \end{align*}
  ```

  (Make sure that $`h`$ is between $`0\degree`$ and $`360\degree`$.)

- Step 5:
  Calculate eccentricity $`e_t`$, hue quadrature composition ($`H`$), and hue composition
  ($`H_c`$).

  Using the following unique hue data in table \ref{table:hue}, set $`h'= h +
  360\degree`$ if $`h < h_1`$, otherwise $`h'=h`$. Choose a proper $`i\in\{1,2,3,4\}`$
  so that $`h_i\le h' < h_{i+1}`$. Calculate

  ```math
  e_t = \tfrac{1}{4}
  \left[
    \cos(h'\pi/180\degree + 2) + 3.8
  \right]
  ```

  which is close to, but not exactly the same as the eccentricity factor given
  in table \ref{table:hue}.

  Hue quadrature is computed using the formula

  ```math
  H = H_i + \frac{100 e_{i+1} (h'-h_i)}{e_{i+1}(h'-h_i) + e_i (h_{i+1}-h')}
  ```

  and hue composition $`H_c`$ is computed according to $`H`$. If $`i=3`$ and $`H =
  241.2116`$ for example, then $`H`$ is between $`H_3`$ and $`H_4`$ (see
  table \ref{table:hue} above). Compute $`P_L=H_4-H = 58.7884`$; $`P_R = H – H_3 =
  41.2116`$ and round $`P_L`$ and $`P_R`$ values to integers $`59`$ and $`41`$. Thus,
  according to table \ref{table:hue}, this sample is considered as having 59%
  of green and 41% of blue, which is the $`H`$c and can be reported as 59G41B or
  41B59G.

- Step 6\*:
  Calculate the achromatic response

  ```math
  A\coloneqq p'_2 \cdot N_{bb}.
  ```

- Step 7:
  Calculate the correlate of lightness

  ```math
  J \coloneqq 100 {(A / A_w)}^{cz}.
  ```

- Step 8:
  Calculate the correlate of brightness

  ```math
  Q \coloneqq \frac{4}{c} \sqrt{\frac{J}{100}} (A_w+4) F_L^{0.25}.
  ```

- Step 9\*:
  Calculate the correlates of chroma ($`C`$), colorfulness ($`M`$), and saturation
  ($`s`$).
  ```math
  \begin{align*}
  t&\coloneqq \frac{50000/13 N_c N_{cb} e_t \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{u + 0.305},\\
  \alpha&\coloneqq t^{0.9} {(1.64 - 0.29^n)}^{0.73},\\
  C&\coloneqq \alpha \sqrt{\frac{J}{100}},\\
  M&\coloneqq C\cdot F_L^{0.25},\\
  s &\coloneqq 50 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha c}{A_w + 4}}.
  \end{align*}
  ```

### Inverse model

- Step 1:
  Obtain $`J`$, $`t`$, and $`h`$ from $`H`$, $`Q`$, $`C`$, $`M`$, $`s`$.

  The input data can be different combinations of perceived correlates, that
  is, $`J`$ or $`Q`$; $`C`$, $`M`$, or $`s`$; and $`H`$ or $`h`$. Hence, the following
  sub-steps are needed to convert the input parameters to the parameters $`J`$,
  $`t`$, and $`h`$.

  - Step 1.1:
    Compute $`J`$ from $`Q`$ (if input is $`Q`$)

    ```math
    J\coloneqq 6.25 \frac{cQ}{(A_w+4) F_L^{0.25}}.
    ```

  - Step 1.2\*:
    Calculate $`t`$ from $`C`$, $`M`$, or $`s`$.

    - If input is $`C`$ or $`M`$:
      ```math
      \begin{align*}
        C &\coloneqq M / F_L^{0.25} \:\text{if input is $M$}\\
        \alpha &\coloneqq \begin{cases}
            0                      & \text{if } J=0,\\
            \frac{C}{\sqrt{J/100}} & \text{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}
      \end{align*}
      ```
    - If input is $`s`$:
      ```math
      \alpha \coloneqq {\left(\frac{s}{50}\right)}^2 \frac{A_w+4}{c}
      ```

    Compute $`t`$ from $`\alpha`$:

    ```math
    t \coloneqq {\left(\frac{\alpha}{{(1.64 - 0.29^n)}^{0.73}}\right)}^{1/0.9}
    ```

  - Step 1.3:
    Calculate $`h`$ from $`H`$ (if input is $`H`$). The correlate of hue ($`h`$) can be
    computed by using data in table \ref{table:hue} in the forward model. Choose a
    proper $`i\in\{1,2,3,4\}`$ such that $`H_i \le H < H_{i+1}`$. Then
    ```math
    h' = \frac{(H-H_i)(e_{i+1}h_i - e_i h_{i+1}) - 100 h_i e_{i+1}}{(H-H_i)(e_{i+1}-e_i) - 100 e_{i+1}}.
    ```
    Set $`h = h' - 360\degree`$ if $`h' > 360\degree`$, and $`h=h'`$ otherwise.

- Step 2:
  Calculate $`e_t`$, $`A`$, $`p'_1`$, and $`p'_2`$

  ```math
  \begin{align*}
  e_t &= \tfrac{1}{4} (\cos(h\pi/180\degree + 2) + 3.8),\\
  A &= A_w  {(J/100)}^{1/(cz)},\\
  p'_1 &= e_t \tfrac{50000}{13} N_c N_{cb},\\
  p'_2 &= A / N_{bb}.
  \end{align*}
  ```

- Step 3\*:
  Calculate $`a`$ and $`b`$

  ```math
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma &\coloneqq \frac{23 (p'_2+0.305) t}{23 p'_1 + 11 t \cos(h) + 108 t \sin(h)},\\
    a &\coloneqq \gamma \cos(h),\\
    b &\coloneqq \gamma \sin(h).
  \end{align*}
  ```

- Step 4:
  Calculate $`R'_a`$, $`G'_a`$, and $`B'_a`$.

  ```math
  \begin{pmatrix}
    R'_a\\G'_a\\B'_a
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \frac{1}{1403}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    460 & 451 & 288\\
    460 & -891 & -261\\
    460 & -220 & -6300
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    p'_2\\a\\b
  \end{pmatrix}.
  ```

- Step 5\*:
  Calculate $`R_c`$, $`G_c`$, and $`B_c`$,

  ```math
  [R,G,B]_c = \operatorname{sign}([R,G,B]'_a)
  \frac{100}{F_L} {\left(
    \frac{27.13 |[R,G,B]'_a|}{400 - |[R,G,B]'_a|}
    \right)}^{1/0.42}.
  ```

- Step 6\*:
  Calculate $`R`$, $`G`$, and $`B`$ from $`R_c`$, $`G_c`$, and $`B_c`$.

  ```math
  [R,G,B] = [R,G,B]_c / D_{[R,G,B]}.
  ```

- Step 7:
  Calculate $`X`$, $`Y`$, and $`Z`$. (For the coefficients of the inverse matrix, see
  the note at the end of the appendix B of \cite{cam16}.)
  ```math
  \begin{pmatrix}X\\Y\\Z\end{pmatrix}
    = M_{16}^{-1}
  \begin{pmatrix}R\\G\\B\end{pmatrix}.
  ```
