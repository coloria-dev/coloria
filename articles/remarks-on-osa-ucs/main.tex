\maketitle

In 1974, MacAdam published the definition of the OSA-UCS color space~\cite{macadam} that
tries to adhere particularly well to experimentally measured color distances. It
combines work that had been going on since the late 1940s.  One aspect of OSA-UCS is
the fact that the conversion from CIEXYZ coordinates into OSA-UCS $Lgj$ coordinates is
straightforward, but the conversion the other way around is not. In fact, there is no
conversion method that works solely in elementary functions. Apparently, this had not
been a design goal of OSA-UCS although is severely limits the usability of OSA-UCS.

In 2002, Kobayasi and Yosiki presented an algorithm for conversion from $Lgj$ to $XYZ$
coordinates  that leverages Newton's method for solving nonlinear equation
systems~\cite{kobayasi}. Unfortunately, the article remains vague at important points
and also contains false assertions about the nature of the involved functions.

In 2013, Cao et al.\ compared Kobayasi's and Yosiki's approach with some other, more
complex methods based on artificial neural networks and found the latter to be
superior~\cite{cao}.

In the present note, the author aims to iron out the inaccuracies in Kobayasi's article
and shows that the Newton-based approach is indeed fully sufficient for the conversion
from OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ.

\section{The forward conversion}

The conversion from CIEXYZ coordinates to OSA-UCS $Lgj$ coordinates is defined as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute $x$, $y$ coordinates via
    \[
      x = \frac{X}{X + Y + Z},\quad y = \frac{Y}{X + Y + Z}.
    \]
  \item Compute $K$ and $Y_0$ as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:KY0}
      \begin{split}
        K &= 4.4934 x^2 + 4.3034 y^2 - 4.276 x y - 1.3744 x - 2.5643 y + 1.8103,\\
        Y_0 &= Y K.
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}

  \item Compute $L'$ and $C$ as
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:lc}
        L' &= 5.9 \left(\sqrt[3]{Y_0} - \frac{2}{3} + 0.042 \sqrt[3]{Y_0 - 30}\right)\\
        \nonumber
        C &= \frac{L'}{5.9 \left(\sqrt[3]{Y_0} - \frac{2}{3}\right)}.
    \end{align}
    (Note that $L'$ is $L$ in the original article~\cite{macadam}.)

  \item Compute RGB as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:m}
      \begin{bmatrix}
        R\\
        G\\
        B
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      M
      \begin{bmatrix}
        X\\
        Y\\
        Z
      \end{bmatrix}
      \quad\text{with}\quad
      M=\begin{bmatrix}
        +0.7990 & 0.4194 & -0.1648\\
        -0.4493 & 1.3265 & +0.0927\\
        -0.1149 & 0.3394 & +0.7170
      \end{bmatrix}.
    \end{equation}

  \item Compute $a$, $b$ as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:ab}
      \begin{bmatrix}
        a\\
        b
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      A
      \begin{bmatrix}
        \sqrt[3]{R}\\
        \sqrt[3]{G}\\
        \sqrt[3]{B}
      \end{bmatrix}
      \quad\text{with}\quad
      A = \begin{bmatrix}
        -13.7 & +17.7 & -4\\
        1.7 & +8 & -9.7
      \end{bmatrix}.
    \end{equation}

  \item Compute $L$, $g$, $j$ as
    \[
      L = \frac{L' - 14.3993}{\sqrt{2}},\quad g = Ca,\quad j = Cb.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\section{The backward conversion}

This section describes the conversion from the  $Lgj$ to the $XYZ$ coordinates and
mostly sticks to Kobayasi~\cite{kobayasi} here.

Given $L$, we can first compute
\[
  L' = L \sqrt{2} + 14.3993.
\]
Equation~\eqref{eq:lc} gives the nonlinear relationship between $L'$ and $Y_0$ from
which we will retrieve $Y_0$. First set $t\coloneqq \sqrt[3]{Y_0}$ and solve
\[
  0 = f(t) \coloneqq {\left(\frac{L'}{5.9} + \frac{2}{3} - t\right)}^3 - 0.042^3 (t^3 - 30)
  % \begin{split}
  %   f'(t) &= -3 {\left(\frac{L'}{5.9} + \frac{2}{3} - t\right)}^2 - 0.042^3 3 t^2.
  % \end{split}
\]
for $t$ using Newton's method. It is clear that $f$ is smooth and monotonically
decreasing (see figure~\ref{fig:singularity}), so it has only one root.
It is reasonable to assume that $t_0 = \frac{L'}{5.9} + \frac{2}{3}$
is a good initial guess for $t$ since the second term in $f(t)$ with $0.042^3$ is
usually small.
Indeed, in practical application it takes less than 10 Newton iterations to achieve
convergence up to a tolerance of $10^{-13}$.

\begin{figure}

  \hfill
  \input{f.tex}

  \caption{Left: Graph of $f(t)$ for $L'=25$. Right: Graph of the function $\phi$ for $L$, $g$, $j$
  computed from $X=12$, $Y=67$, $Z=20$. The singularity is at $w\approx 0.59652046418$.
  Note that the function as three roots only the largest of which is of
  interest.}\label{fig:singularity}
\end{figure}

From here, one can compute
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gather}
  Y_0 = t^3,\quad
  C = \frac{L'}{5.9 \left(t - \frac{2}{3}\right)},\quad
  a = \frac{g}{C},\quad
  b = \frac{j}{C}.
\end{equation}
With $a$ and $b$ at hand, it is now possible via equation~\eqref{eq:ab} to pin down
$(\sqrt[3]{R}, \sqrt[3]{G}, \sqrt[3]{B})$ to only one degree of freedom, $w$.
The exact value of $w$ will be found by another Newton iteration. The function $\phi(w)$
of which a root needs to be found is defined as follows.
\begin{quotation}
  Append the matrix $A$~\eqref{eq:ab} with a row such that the new $3\times3$-matrix
  $\tilde{A}$ is nonsingular and solve
  \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
      a\\
      b\\
      w
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \tilde{A}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \sqrt[3]{R}\\
      \sqrt[3]{G}\\
      \sqrt[3]{B}
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  (Kobayasi, for instance, appends $[1, 0, 0]$ which means setting $w=\sqrt[3]{R}$.)
  Then compute the tentative $\tilde{X}$, $\tilde{Y}$, $\tilde{Z}$ via~\eqref{eq:m} and
  further get the corresponding tentative $\tilde{Y}_0$ from~\eqref{eq:KY0}. Then
  $\phi(w) = \tilde{Y}_0(w) - Y_0$.
\end{quotation}

If the difference between $\tilde{Y}_0(w)$ and $Y_0$ from~\eqref{eq:gather} is 0, the
correct $w$ has been found.  Kobayasi states the function $\phi$ is ``monotone
increasing, convex downward, and smooth''. Unfortunately, none of this is true (see
figure~\ref{fig:singularity}). In fact, the function has a singularity at $w$ chosen
such that the computed tentative $\tilde{X}$, $\tilde{Y}$, $\tilde{Z}$ sum up to 0 while
the individual values of $|\tilde{X}|, |\tilde{Y}|, |\tilde{Z}| > 0$. This happens if
the tentative $[R, G, B]$ is orthogonal on $[1,1,1] M^{-1}$.

Fortunately, it seems that the function is indeed convex to the right of the
singularity.  Newton's method will hence find the correct (largest) root if the initial
guess $w_0$ is chosen larger than the root. Since $w$ corresponds to $\sqrt[3]{R}$, it
is reasonable to chose $w_0$ to be the maximum possible value that $\sqrt[3]{R}$ can
take, namely that corresponding to $X=Y=100$, $Z=0$ (see~\ref{eq:m}), $w_0=\sqrt[3]{79.9
+ 41.94}\approx 4.9575$.

\begin{remark}
  Cao et al.~\cite{cao} found that the conversion to from $Lgj$ to $XYZ$ takes so long
  that alternative methods needs to be researched. They even find that the Newton
  iterations sometimes do not converge, or find the correct result only to few digits of
  accuracy.  The author cannot confirm these observations. On the contrary: The
  conversion is faster than CIECAM02's, and the computation of millions of coordinates
  at once merely takes a second of computation time on a recent computer
  (figure~\ref{fig:speed}).

  To achieve this speed, it is important to vectorize all computation, i.e., not to
  perform the conversion for each $Lgj$-tuple individually one after another, but to
  perform all steps on the array. This also means to perform the Newton iteration on all
  tuples until all tuples have converged successfully, even if some already
  converge in the first step. The redundant work inflicted by this approach is far
  outweighed by the advantages of vectorization.

  All code is published as open-source in~\cite{colorio}.
