  #### Abstract
  A color-difference dataset was developed for testing the performance of color
  metrics. The dataset comprises 45 color-difference vectors varying in five
  directions at nine color centers under conditions typical of commercial color
  decisions. Probit analysis was used to estimate the parameters of the
  population distribution of tolerances for each vector. In addition to
  estimating the median tolerance, the anlysis allows one to estimate the
  uncertainty of a tolerance and to test the adequacy of the underlying model
  tolerance distribution. The median tolerances were used to specify 45
  color-difference pairs with equal visual color-difference magnitudes. The
  performance of eight color-difference metrics was compared using the
  normalized standard deviation of the color differences of the visually equal
  difference pairs as a measure of uniformity. A bootstrap statistical
  technique was used to quantify the variation in performance with varying
  samples of color centers and color-difference directions and to determine the
  significance of observed differences in uniformity performance. Some metrics
  based on weighted CIELAB dl*, dC*, dH* color-difference components had
  significantly superior performance compared to the CIE recommended
  color-difference metrics.

  #### Abstract
  A generalized color-difference space was introduced based on theories of
  multi-stage color vision, for example, the zone theory, and extended by
  integrating line elements. This space had the following features: chromatic
  adaptation, a linear transformation from CIE tristimulus values to cone
  fundamentals, a nonlinear compression stage, a second linear transformation
  to opponent signals, and line-element integration that was a function of
  chroma.  Variants of this generalized color-difference space were derived
  using the RIT-DuPont and Qiao et al. datasets of equal perceived color
  differences. These spaces had improved performance compared with CIELAB and
  resulted in a Euclidean distance metric with statistically equivalent or
  superior performance to the current CIE recommended color-difference formula,
  CIEDE2000.
