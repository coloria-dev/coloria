### Abstract

Varying magnitude of colour differences from threshold up to moderate size in
painted sample pairs at five CIE colour centers was estimated by grey scale
assessment. Painted samples were produced for constant step width along the
main axes of previously determined threshold (x,y,Y)-ellipsoids with lightness
variation at constant (x,y)-chromaticity starting with threshold length and
enlarging it five times for moderate magnitude of colour difference. Pairs were
formed for linear extensions along axes and for diagonal combinations at equal
step width between axes. The model under test assumes additive linear scale
extension in constant proportions of the threshold (x,y,Y)-ellipsoid for
increasing magnitude of perceived colour difference and correlates perceptual
main colour characters with main ellipsoid axes. Both assumptions were
falsified to some degree: in general, magnitude of colour difference varies
differently, though close to linear, and slightly subadditive for the three
axes and for the different colour centers; the short (x,y)-ellipse axis in some
cases is not correlated with a perceptual hue vector component, and the main
lightness direction sometimes is tilted in relation to the (x,y)-plane. Three
colour-difference formulae do not provide better global predictions than the
local (x,y,Y)-ellipsoid formulae. The results may be used for more detailed
modeling of colour-difference formulae and for tolerance settings at different
ranges of colour difference.
